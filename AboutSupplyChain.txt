About: 

The main structures used to create the `Details` page in the provided code include:

1. **React Functional Component**:
   - The entire page is encapsulated within a React functional component named `Details`.
   - This component uses React hooks (`useState`) to manage the state of various form fields and data.

2. **State Management**:
   - Multiple pieces of state are managed using the `useState` hook, including:
     - Text inputs (`companyName`, `username`, `password`, etc.)
     - Checkboxes (`inventoryLevels`)
     - File upload (`pdfFile`)
     - An array to store multiple shipments (`deliveryShipments`)

3. **Form Structure**:
   - An HTML form (`<form>`) is used to collect user input. The form is structured with input fields, labels, and buttons.
   - The `onSubmit` event handler is used to manage form submission.

4. **Input Fields**:
   - Various types of input fields are used, such as text inputs (`<input type="text">`), password inputs (`<input type="password">`), datetime inputs (`<input type="datetime-local">`), and file upload (`<input type="file">`).
   - Checkboxes (`<input type="checkbox">`) are used for selecting multiple inventory levels.

5. **Event Handling**:
   - Event handlers such as `onChange`, `onSubmit`, and `onClick` are used to handle user interactions with the form fields.
   - Example: `handleLogin`, `handleAddShipment`, `handleInventoryLevelChange`, and `handlePdfUpload`.

6. **Conditional Rendering**:
   - The page conditionally renders a table displaying the list of delivery shipments only if there are shipments in the `deliveryShipments` array.

7. **Routing**:
   - React Router's `Link` component is used for navigation, allowing users to move to different parts of the application (e.g., back to the home page or to the dashboard).

8. **CSS Classes**:
   - The page uses various CSS classes (e.g., `login-container`, `login-input`, `login-button`) to style the elements. The styles are assumed to be defined in the linked `details.css` file.

9. **Table Structure**:
   - An HTML table (`<table>`) is used to display the list of delivery shipments, with columns for supplier name, order ID, sent time, received time, shipment price, and inventory levels.

These structures together form the functional and visual layout of the `Details` page, allowing users to input and manage supply chain data.
